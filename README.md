# Cloud-ETL-Pipeline-for-Partner-Data-Analysis
Youâ€™ll create an ETL pipeline using Google Cloud services to store and process data, and then visualize the results in Tableau. The ETL pipeline will extract data (simulated partner data), transform it (clean and aggregate), and load it into Google BigQuery. Tableau will connect to BigQuery to visualize insights from the processed data.
